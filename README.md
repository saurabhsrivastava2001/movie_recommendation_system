## 📥 **Installation & Setup**  

### 🔹 **1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender.git
cd movie-recommender
```

### 🔹 **2. Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)  
```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # For Mac/Linux
env\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
```

### 🔹 **3. Install Dependencies**  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔹 **4. Handle Model Files (`.pkl`)**  
Since the **model files are too large** to upload directly to GitHub, you need to **download them before running the project**.

#### 📌 **Option 1: Download Model from Google Drive (Recommended)**
1. **Download model files manually** from Google Drive:  
   - [movie_list.pkl](YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK_1)  
   - [similarity.pkl](YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK_2)  
2. Place them inside the `model/` directory.

OR  

Modify `utils.py` to **automatically download** them:

```python
import gdown
import pickle
import os

def download_model():
    """Downloads the model files from Google Drive if not present."""
    files = {
        "movie_list.pkl": "YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FILE_ID_1",
        "similarity.pkl": "YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FILE_ID_2",
    }

    if not os.path.exists("model"):
        os.makedirs("model")

    for file, file_id in files.items():
        if not os.path.exists(f"model/{file}"):
            print(f"Downloading {file}...")
            gdown.download(f"https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}", f"model/{file}", quiet=False)

def load_model():
    """Loads the recommendation model after downloading it if necessary."""
    download_model()
    movies = pickle.load(open("model/movie_list.pkl", "rb"))
    similarity = pickle.load(open("model/similarity.pkl", "rb"))
    return movies, similarity
```
Replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FILE_ID_1"` and `"YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FILE_ID_2"` with actual file IDs.

---

#### 📌 **Option 2: Upload Model to GitHub LFS**
If you want to **store the model files in GitHub**, use **Git LFS**.

1. Install Git LFS  
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   ```
2. Track `.pkl` files  
   ```sh
   git lfs track "*.pkl"
   ```
3. Commit & push  
   ```sh
   git add .gitattributes
   git add model/movie_list.pkl model/similarity.pkl
   git commit -m "Add model files using Git LFS"
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### 🔹 **5. Run the Application**  
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will run locally at **http://localhost:8501**
